# install-msi-upon-startup
Powershell script to boot upon startup, comparing installed .msi to .msi in mentioned directory, and installing/updating as necessary.

Useful for troubleshooting an application that requires a separate team to log in to a test environment and manually check a sharepoint/install updates. Upon frequent back and forth bug finds/fixes, this can get quite tedious. I am working with no hard completion date set, however I feel like this is not too difficult a task.
